# Spotify App

This is a portfolio piece, built with React, Node, and Express to interact with the Spotify API.

## Running Locally

1. Register a Spotify App in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and add `http://localhost:8080/callback` as a Redirect URI in the app settings

2. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project based on `.env.example` and add your unique `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the Spotify dashboard


3. Install dependencies

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the React app on <http://localhost:3000> and the Node server on <http://localhost:8080>
